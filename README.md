# Weather App
A full-stack weather app using Vue.js and Weather API to fetch weather data for searched locations.

This is my the first project I've built for VueJS as a means to test my understanding of this framework
## Features

- Altering Background depending on whether it's hot or cold
- Search a country or city and the API will fetch the weather data for that location
